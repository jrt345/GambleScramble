## GambleScramble Features:

When you start off the game the player starts with 100 dollars (USD) and can gamble their money with the following games:

1. CoinToss
2. DiceRoll 
3. HandGuess
4. Rock Paper Scissors

These games are based on chance, with CoinToss and Rock Paper Scissors having 1:2 odds of wining and a 2x payout; DiceRoll having 1:6 odds of winning and a 5x payout; HandGuess has a 1:11 odds and a 10x payout. More complex games will be added as this game gets updated.

The player can wish to convert their currency to the following currencies:

1. USD (default)
2. EUR
3. GBP
4. AUD
5. CAD
6. NZD

*Note: When converting currencies the conversion will round down the new balance to the current whole number.*

*Note: The exchange rates of the currencies are based on the time of the latest release.*

There are five themes: Light theme (default), Dark theme, Hacker theme, Slate theme, and Rose theme, which can be changed in the options menu.
